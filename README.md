This is assignment #4 for HHA507

# Markdown Reflections:
## Flask
I did not face any challenges with Flask.
## Shiny R
The difference I had with shiny R was during the deployment process. I kept trying to deploy to the shiny app, but it would deploy to posit cloud instead. This may be the expected behaviour but I am not sure. The other difficulty I had is that I am not familiar with R so it took me a while to figure it out and write the application. 
## Shiny Python
 I did not have any challenges with Shiny Python, I was able to successfully deploy and it showed up on Shiny.io. 

The interactivity and user experience was similar across all platforms.  
For Shiny I did not need a seperate html file, but for flask I did need a seperate html file.
